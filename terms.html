                <p>
                    Peephole Team may grant you a license to certain virtual goods, known as Virtual Items, for use within the Service.
                    These Virtual Items may be acquired through gameplay or purchased with real money. The license for Virtual Items is limited,
                    personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable, and is solely for non-commercial use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peephole Team reserves the right to manage, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice.
                    The transfer of Virtual Items is generally prohibited, unless expressly authorized within the Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Virtual Items do not hold any cash value and cannot be exchanged for real money or other items of value.
                    Peephole Team and any other party are not obligated to exchange Virtual Items for anything of value,
                    and Peephole Team bears no liability for any hacking or loss of Virtual Items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The price and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.
                    All purchases and redemptions of Virtual Items made through the Services are final and non-refundable,
                    except where required by mandatory legislation. By making a purchase, you acknowledge and consent that the provision of
                    Virtual Items begins immediately upon purchase, and you forfeit your right of withdrawal once the performance has started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You agree that Peephole Team is not obligated to provide refunds for Virtual Items for any reason,
                    including but not limited to the deletion of your account or cessation of use of the game.
                    Upon request for erasure of your personal data as outlined in Peephole Team's Privacy Policy,
                    you will permanently lose all Virtual Items associated with your account without the right to a refund.

                <h3>4.2 Subscriptions</h3>
                <h4>Billing and Renewal</h4>
                <p>
                    Certain parts of the Service operate under subscription models ("Subscriptions").
                    Subscribing grants ongoing access to dynamic content or services within the Apps.
                    Subscriptions may be offered at various fees for defined periods ("Subscription Periods") as specified within the App.
                    Payment will be processed from your iTunes or Google Play account ("Account") upon confirmation of the Subscription
                    through the Apps's available confirmation mechanisms. Your subscription will continue and automatically renew unless canceled
                    at least 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription.
                    You consent to our charging your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge,
                    until such time as you cancel the applicable order. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription
                    plan you choose when you subscribed to the Services.
                </p>

                <h4>Free Trial</h4>
                <p>
                    A Trial Subscription is provided at no cost for a specific duration from activation, as indicated in the respective
                    offer within the App. If you do not cancel the Subscription within this period, the Subscription Fee will be deducted
                    from your Account upon the trial period's conclusion. It's important to note that your Subscription starts immediately
                    upon activating the trial, not after the trial period.
                </p>
